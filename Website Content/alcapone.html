      <p class="test">Alphonse Gabriel Capone (January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the 
        nicknames "Scarface" and "Snorky", was an American gangster and businessman who attained 
        notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit from 
        1925 to 1931. His seven-year reign as a crime boss ended when he went to prison at the age

			<h3>Early life</h3>
			<p1>Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, on January 17, 
    1899. His parents were Italian immigrants Gabriele Capone (1865–1920) and Teresa Capone 
    (née Raiola; 1867–1952). His father was a barber and his mother was a seamstress, both 
    born in Angri, a small comune outside of Naples in the Province of Salerno. Capone's 
    family had immigrated to the United States in 1893 by ship, first going through Fiume 
    (modern-day Rijeka, Croatia), a port city in what was then Austria-Hungary. The family 
    settled at 95 Navy Street, in the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn. When Al was aged 11, he 
    and his family moved to 38 Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Al Capone showed 
    promise as a student but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial Catholic 
    school. His schooling ended at the age of 14 after he was expelled for hitting a female 
    teacher in the face. Capone worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store 
    and a bowling alley. From 1916 to 1918 he played semi-professional baseball. Following 
    this, Capone was influenced by gangster Johnny Torrio, whom he came to regard as a mentor. 
    Capone married Mae Josephine Coughlin at age 19, on December 30, 1918. She was Irish Catholic 
    and earlier that month had given birth to their son Albert Francis "Sonny" Capone (1918–2004). 
    Albert lost most of his hearing in his left ear as a child. Capone was under the age of 21, 
    and his parents had to consent in writing to the marriage. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage.</p1>

			<h3>Career</h3>
			<div> <h6>New York City</h6>
  <p2>Capone initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful Five Points Gang based in Lower Manhattan. During this time he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer Frankie Yale, a bartender in a Coney Island dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. Capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door, and he was slashed with a knife three times on the left side of his face by her brother, Frank Galluccio; the wounds led to the nickname "Scarface", which Capone loathed. The date when this occurred has been reported with inconsistencies. When Capone was photographed, he hid the scarred left side of his face, saying that the injuries were war wounds. He was called "Snorky" by his closest friends, a term for a sharp dresser.</p2>

  <div><h6>Move to Chicago</h6>
  <p2>In 1919, Capone left New York City for Chicago at the invitation of Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James "Big Jim" Colosimo as an enforcer. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where it is thought the most likely way for him to have contracted syphilis. According to the Chicago Daily Tribune, hijacker Joe Howard was killed on May 7, 1923, after he tried to interfere with the Capone-Torrio bootlegging business. In the early years of the decade, Capone's name began appearing in newspaper sports pages where he was described as a boxing promoter. Torrio took over Colosimo's criminal empire after the latter's murder on May 11, 1920, in which Capone was suspected of being involved. Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in Chicago, with Capone as his right-hand man. Torrio was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller North Side Gang, led by Dean O'Banion, came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the Gennas' encroachment, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes. In a fateful step, Torrio arranged the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. This placed Hymie Weiss at the head of the gang, backed by Vincent Drucci and Bugs Moran. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers. During Prohibition, Capone was involved with Canadian bootleggers who helped him smuggle liquor into the U.S. When Capone was asked if he knew Rocco Perri, billed as Canada's "King of the Bootleggers", he replied: "Why, I don't even know which street Canada is on." Other sources, however, claim that Capone had certainly visited Canada, where he maintained some hideaways, but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police states that there is no "evidence that he ever set foot on Canadian soil."</p2>

			<h3>Imprisonment</h3>
      <p3>Capone was sent to Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, Capone was officially diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhoea. He was also experiencing withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his nasal septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent. He was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying at the hands of fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudensky, feared that Capone would have a breakdown. Rudensky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the Capone gang and found himself becoming a protector for Capone. The conspicuous protection by Rudensky and other prisoners, drew accusations from less friendly inmates and fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary off the coast of San Francisco, in August 1934. On June 23, 1936, Capone was stabbed and superficially wounded by fellow Alcatraz inmate James C. Lucas. Due to his good behavior, Capone was permitted to play banjo in the Alcatraz prison band, the Rock Islanders, which gave regular Sunday concerts for other inmates. Capone also transcribed the song "Madonna Mia" creating his own arrangement as a tribute to his wife Mae. At Alcatraz, Capone's decline became increasingly evident, as neurosyphilis progressively eroded his mental faculties; his formal diagnosis of syphilis of the brain was made in February 1938. He spent the last year of his Alcatraz sentence in the hospital section, confused and disoriented. Capone completed his term in Alcatraz on January 6, 1939, and was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island in California to serve out his sentence for contempt of court.[118] He was paroled on November 16, 1939, after his wife Mae appealed to the court, based on his reduced mental capabilities.</p3>

			<h3>Death &amp; Aftermath</h3>
      <p4>In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist examined him and concluded that Capone had the mentality of a 12-year-old child. He suffered a cardiac arrest on January 22, and on January 25, surrounded by his family in his home, died after his heart failed as a result of apoplexy. The main effect of Capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of Capone portrayed it as a considerable undermining of the city's organized crime syndicate. Capone's underboss, Frank Nitti, took over as boss of the Outfit after he was released from prison in March 1932, having also been convicted of tax evasion charges. Far from being smashed, the Outfit continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once Prohibition was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead "front boss". Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld. Some historians have speculated that Capone ordered the 1939 murder of Edward J. O'Hare a week before his release, for helping federal prosecutors convict Capone of tax evasion, though there are other theories for O'Hare's death.
