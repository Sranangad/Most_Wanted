      <p class="test">Carlo Gambino (August 24, 1902 – October 15, 1976) was a Sicilian-born American 
        crime boss who was the leader and namesake of the Gambino crime family of New York City. 
        Following the Apalachin Meeting in 1957 and the imprisonment of Vito Genovese in 1959, Gambino 
        took over the Commission of the American Mafia and played a powerful role in organized crime 
        until his death from a heart attack in 1976. During a criminal career that spanned over fifty 
        years, Gambino served only twenty-two months in prison for a tax evasion charge in 1937. </p>

			<h3>Early life</h3>
			<div><p1>Carlo Gambino was born in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, on August 24, 1902, to a family that belonged to a Sicilian Mafia gang from Passo di Rigano He had two brothers: Gaspare, who was not involved with the Mafia, and Paolo, who was a part of what would become the Gambino crime family. His parents were Italian immigrants Tommaso Gambino and Felice Castellano.</p1></div>
            <div><p1>Gambino entered the United States on December 23, 1921, at Norfolk, Virginia, as a stowaway on the SS Vincenzo Florio. He made his way to New York City to join his cousins, the Castellanos, and worked for a small trucking firm owned by their family. Gambino later moved to a modest house located at 2230 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; his Long Island residence, located at 34 Club Drive in Massapequa, New York, served as his summer home. The two-story brick house, surrounded by a low fence with marble statues on the front lawn, was at the end of a cul-de-sac in Harbor Green Estates, overlooking the South Oyster Bay.</p1></div>
            <div><p1>In 1932, Gambino married one of his cousins, Catherine Castellano, sister of future Gambino family boss Paul Castellano. They raised four children – sons Thomas, Joseph (March 28, 1936 – February 20, 202) and Carlo (born 1934) and a daughter, Phyllis Gambino Sinatra (September 22, 1927 – February 19, 2007).</p1></div>

			<h3>Career & Imprisonment</h3>
  <div><p2>In New York, Gambino joined a criminal organization headed by Joe Masseria, another 
    Sicilian-born gangster. In 1930 Gambino was arrested in Lawrence, Massachusetts, as a suspicious 
    person. That charge was dismissed, but he was seized a month later in Brockton, Massachusetts, on a 
    larceny charge. A warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to show up in court. Four years 
    later, he was arrested in Manhattan as a fugitive and was returned to Brockton, where the larceny 
    charge was dropped when he made restitution of $1,000.</p2></div>

    <div><p2>After Masseria's death, Gambino and his cousins became soldiers in the family headed by
         Mangano. Despite being a mob power in his own right, Albert Anastasia was nominally the 
         underboss of the Mangano family. During his twenty-year rule, Mangano had resented Anastasia's 
         close ties to Luciano and Costello, particularly the fact that they had obtained Anastasia's 
         services without first seeking Mangano's permission. This and other business disputes led to 
         heated, almost physical fights between the two mobsters.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>Gambino was arrested in 1937 for tax evasion related to operating a million-gallon 
        distillery in Philadelphia. He served twenty-two months in prison at the United States 
        Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, the only period in his long criminal career during 
        which he was incarcerated.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>In 1957, Genovese decided to move against Costello and Anastasia, enlisting Gambino–Anastasia's 
        underboss– in the murder conspiracy. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to carry out the hit on 
        Costello, which was attempted outside Costello's apartment building on May 2, 1957. Although the 
        wound was superficial, the brush with death persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and 
        retire. Although a doorman identified Gigante as the gunman, Costello claimed to not recognize him 
        at Gigante's 1958 trial; Gigante was acquitted on charges of attempted murder.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>With Costello gone, Genovese and Gambino allegedly ordered Anastasia's murder. Gambino gave the contract
    to Profaci, who then allegedly assigned the hit to Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo. Anastasia was murdered 
    on October 25, 1957, in the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>Gambino subsequently took over the Mangano crime family, which took his name going forward. 
        He appointed Joseph Biondo as underboss, though Biondo was replaced by Aniello Dellacroce in 1965.</p2></div>
    
    <div><p2>Gambino and Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to 
    falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 17, 1959, Genovese was sentenced to fifteen years 
    in prison for drug offenses; he died in custody on February 14, 1969.</p2></div> 
    <div><p2>On January 26, 1962, Luciano died of a heart attack at Naples International Airport. Three 
        days later, 300 people attended a funeral service for Luciano in Naples, during which his body 
        was conveyed along the streets in a horse-drawn black hearse. With the permission of the U.S. 
        government, Luciano's relatives took his body back to New York for burial at St. John's Cemetery 
        in Middle Village, Queens. More than 2,000 mourners attended his funeral. Gambino, Luciano's 
        longtime friend, gave his eulogy.</p2></div>
    
    <div><p2>After Genovese's imprisonment, Gambino took control of The Commission. Under his leadership, 
    the Gambino crime family had 500 soldiers and over 1,000 associates.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>In 1962, Gambino's oldest son, Thomas, married Lucchese's daughter Frances. Over 1,000 
        guests attended the wedding, at which Gambino presented Lucchese with a $30,000 gift. In return, 
        Lucchese gave Gambino a part of his rackets at Idlewild Airport (now called John F. Kennedy 
        Airport). Lucchese exercised control over airport security and airport unions. As a team, 
        Lucchese and Gambino now controlled the airport, the Commission, and most organized crime in 
        New York.</p2></div>
    
    <div><p2>In 1963, Joseph Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, made plans to assassinate 
        several rivals on The Commission—bosses Gambino, Lucchese, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as 
        Frank DeSimone. Bonanno sought Joseph Magliocco's support, and Magliocco, bitter over being 
        previously denied a seat on The Commission, readily agreed. Bonanno promised to make Magliocco 
        his right-hand man in exchange for his assistance.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>Deportation proceedings against Gambino were started by the Immigration and Naturalization 
        Service as early as 1953, but made no headway for several years because of his heart condition 
        and constant hospitalizations. In 1970 he was indicted on charges of conspiring to hijack an 
        armored car carrying $3 million, and was arrested on March 23, 1970. He was released on $75,000 
        bail, and was never brought to trial because of his health. The same year, the U.S. Supreme Court 
        upheld a 1967 order, that he previously appealed, that he be deported because he had entered the 
        country illegally. When the government tried to carry out the order, Gambino was rushed to a 
        hospital after he had suffered a massive heart attack.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times by Jerome A. Johnson, one being in the head, 
        at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian-American Civil 
        Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo's bodyguards. Colombo was permanently 
        paralyzed from the shooting, and later died in 1978.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>Although many in the Colombo family blamed Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually 
        concluded that Johnson was a lone gunman after they had questioned Gallo. Since Johnson had spent 
        time a few days earlier at a club run by the Gambino family, one theory was that Gambino organized 
        the shooting. Colombo had refused to listen to Gambino's complaints about the League, and allegedly 
        spat in Gambino's face during one argument. However, the Colombo family leadership was convinced that 
        Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family. Gallo was murdered on April 7, 1972.</p2></div>
    <div><p2>After Genovese's death, Gerardo Catena became the new boss of the Genovese family. However, 
        he was indicted and jailed in 1970. Thomas Eboli then became the "front boss" of the family for 
        the next two years. However, Eboli wanted to run the family for real and borrowed $4 million from 
        Gambino to finance a new drug trafficking operation. However, law enforcement soon shut down Eboli's 
        drug racket and arrested most of his crew. Gambino allegedly ordered Eboli's murder. While it was 
        initially thought that this was due to Eboli's failure to pay back the loan, it is now believed that 
        Gambino actually wanted to replace Eboli with Frank "Funzi" Tieri, and that Gambino used the loan as 
        a pretext. On July 16, 1972, Eboli left his girlfriend's apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and 
        walked to his chauffeured Cadillac. As he sat in the parked car, a gunman in a passing truck shot him 
        five times. Hit in the head and neck, Eboli died instantly. No one was ever charged in this murder.</p2></div>

			<h3>Death & Aftermath</h3>
      <div><p3>Gambino died at his Massapequa home in the early morning hours of Friday, October 15, 1976, 
        aged 74. having watched the television broadcast of the New York Yankees winning the American League 
        pennant the previous evening. The official cause was natural causes, and his death was not unexpected, 
        given a history of heart disease. Cusimano & Russo Funeral Home hosted his wake over the weekend of 
        October 16 and 17. His funeral mass was held on Monday, October 18, at the Church of Our Lady of 
        Grace in Brooklyn. Gambino was then entombed within his family's private room in the Cloister 
        building of St. John Cemetery in Queens. His funeral and wake were attended by several hundred people, 
        with plainclothes police and FBI agents mingling outside. His funeral procession consisted of 
        thirteen limousines, around a dozen private cars and one flower car.</p3></div>
        <div><p3>Against expectations, Gambino had previously appointed Castellano to succeed him over his 
            underboss Dellacroce. Gambino appeared to believe that the family would benefit from Castellano's 
            focus on white-collar crime.[  Dellacroce, at the time, was imprisoned for tax evasion and was 
            unable to contest Castellano's succession.</p3></div>
        <div><p3>Castellano's succession was confirmed at a meeting on November 24, with Dellacroce present. 
            Castellano arranged for Dellacroce to remain as underboss while directly running traditional Mafia 
            activities such as extortion, robbery and loansharking. While Dellacroce accepted Castellano's 
            succession, the deal effectively split the Gambino family into two rival factions.</p3></div>
